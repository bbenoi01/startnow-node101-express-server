Welcome!
Thank you for checking out my Express Server Project.

Project Description:

This is a simple project which uses the Express framework to help build a simple server. The primary goal of this project was to practice GET requests as well as using morgan to log each request to the console. When user visits the route '/data', the data from the San Diego Top Spots project will be displayed on the screen for the user to see.

How to open:

Using the command prompt, copy and paste 'code ~/oca/startnow-node101-express-server' and push enter. This will open the project in visual studio code. To start and test this application, run 'node index.js' in Terminal, after navigating to the server folder.
